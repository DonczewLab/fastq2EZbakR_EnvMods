# fastq2EZbakR_EnvMods
A Snakemake pipeline designed to process nucleotide recoding RNA-seq data (NR-seq, e.g., TimeLapse-seq, SLAM-seq, TUC-seq, etc.). fastq2EZbakR provides output readily compatible with EZbakR, but is also designed to provide processed NR-seq data in a convenient form. fastq2EZbakR_EnvMods takes the same original workflow but converts to env mods
